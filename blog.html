            <p>This is a test post created for my new blog which you are somehow currently reading, horray!! Welcome, I’ve started this blog with the hopes of being able to share my knowledge and experiences as a software engineering student. While I might currently be stuck working on mulivariable calculus I still get up to some programming in my spare time and I thought what better of a place to share it than <em>yet another</em> software engineering blog floating around on the internet.

Anyway, for the remainder of this post I am going to be trying out some of the various features that should be up and running on the blog now! This blog is created using <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank">Jekyll</a> so here I’ll just make sure I set everything up correctly :)

First lets try out some mathmatical renderings using <a href="https://www.mathjax.org" target="_blank">MathJax</a>!</p>
